# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug.
- Discussing the current state of the code.
- Submitting a fix.
- Proposing new features.
- Becoming a maintainer.

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

### We Use GitHub Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[GitHub Flow]). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

### Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue];
it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
tried that didn't work).

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- You can try running `yarn lint` for style unification.

## License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License] that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.
