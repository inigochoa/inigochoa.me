# The website

This website is designed to minimise the energy consumption and CO2 emissions
that result from navigating the internet. The interface uses system typefaces
(Arial and Helvetica) to avoid unnecessary HTTP requests and it is available in
dark mode, following the OS color scheme's preference by default, thus reducing
screen brightness and energy consumption - especially in mobile use where OLED
screens are most common.

The design is intended to be as clear as possible to avoid loading unwanted
content. [inigochoa.me] is a static site with zero server-side resource
consumption and it's hosted on DigitalOcean 100% renewable energy servers.
