# Privacy policy

## Summary

I respect the EU's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy
explains that I do not collect or process any of your information. You won't
find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I've no
desire to trick you into agreeing to something you might later regret.

## Why I value your privacy

I value your privacy as much as I do my own, so I've committed not to collect
your personal information. I am not comfortable with the information that
companies, governments and other organizations keep on file, so I do not ask
anything of my visitors. I do not have personal information so I do not have
to give anyone access to anything.

## Changes to the policy

I have no intention of changing the content of this policy. If it is still
necessary, the changes will become effective the moment I publish the on my
website.
