# About me

I am Iñigo Ochoa, a backend developer from the Basque Country, Spain. I work at
Veiss Comunicación and I develop web and mobile applications, both iOS and
Android.

I work mainly with PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, PostgreSQL and GraphQL, although I
always try to keep up to date with the new frameworks that come out.

Personally, I like listening to music and podcasts, watching series and movies,
and basketball. I've been teaching basketball to the kids at the school where I
studied for +11 years.

You can always find my contact information on my [NPM card] by running
`npx @inigochoa/card` in a console.
